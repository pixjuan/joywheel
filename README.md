# Joywheel

Jowheel is a wheel based game controller. Initially it was designed to play [Sabotage](https://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/sabotage/reviews/reviewerId,7471/) on Mame and add an [Exergaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergaming) touch to the game, but it can be used for any other games that use keyboard input.

There are specific build instructions and software for each version of the controller. The whole project is documented on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/168427-usb-crank-stick)
